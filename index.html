						<h4>Harold – Minnesota</h4>
						<p>Due to a major personal crisis and circumstances beyond my control, I ended up deep in tax trouble.  I allowed this situation to go on for several years before I was forced to confront the problem, by way of an IRS levy letter.  Needless to say, I quickly learned my lesson, that ignoring the problem was the wrong thing to do.  I was panicked and so I contacted Tax Tiger, who were caring, compassionate and encouraging.  They were so wonderful.  They really listened to me and I could tell that they genuinely cared about me and my problem.  I wasn’t just another case to them.  I owed about $10,000 and received a settlement for about $350.  I have nothing but praise for David and the entire staff of The Tax Gator.  A HUGE weight was taken off of my shoulders and I have thanked God many times for this this awesome company and the help they gave me.</p>

						<h4>Barbara – South Carolina</h4>
						<p>The Tax Gator staff climbed mountains for me, just when I needed it.  When you first get the shock and scary news that the IRS wants money from you, Tax Tiger will protect you and resolve the problem.  I found the IRS at my front door step, yes, literally knocking at my door, on my day off from work.  It was unreal.  I am a steady taxpayer and found out, by mistake, that I owed money from a closed business.  I’m back in the regular 9-to-5 workforce now, and I don’t make much money, so it was really scary for me, as to what to do.   I searched the Internet for help.  There are a ton of advertisements about getting help for stuff like this, but who do you trust, how does it work, and could they really help me?  They were a few hundred miles away, but I called them and within a few minutes I felt calm. They immediately gave me peace of mind.  I gave them the paperwork requested and The Tax Gator worked very hard and never gave up, even when the IRS came back fighting. They know what to do and did it. I won! They protected me through all of the negotiations and made everything understandable.  It is over now, I am glad that I decided to hire The Tax Gator and this is all behind me. Without The Tax Gator, the IRS would have taken everything and I’d be broke. Instead, I was able to rid myself of this problem and did it the right way. I’m so glad I found them and could never thank them enough for what they did for us!</p>

						<h4>Kathy – Texas</h4>
						<p>After being married for almost 3 years, to a man who physically and mentally abused me…I finally escaped.  The trouble is that I later discovered that he had been telling me that our joint taxes had been taken care of by a family member of his that was an accountant but, in reality, he had not done anything.  It felt like it was out of nowhere – I was 6 years behind in back taxes and didn’t know where to turn.  I got online and found a Christian company, named The Tax Gator.  By the time I got off the phone with them, I felt like I had a ton of bricks lifted off my shoulders.  The next few months, they stayed in contact with me and anytime I had questions they were always considerate and helpful.  They helped me so much.  After going back and forth with the IRS, they reached an settlement offer.  Without The Tax Gator and the people that work there, I’d probably still be looking over my shoulder all the time but, instead, I’m holding my head high.  Thank you, for treating me more like a friend than a customer.  God Bless you and keep you safe!</p>

						<h4>Ralph – Colorado</h4>
						<p>I want to thank your whole staff for being so professional and persistent in getting the IRS off of my back!  The Tax Gator got my settlement signed, sealed and delivered, just as promised. I had a tax debt that kept me awake at night and stressed me out during the day. Your staff took on the IRS, like gangbusters, and fought hard for my case. Now I am in the process of paying my settlement and I couldn’t be happier. I no longer feel the impending doom and helplessness that I always felt from the IRS and I feel my life can now move forward.  I would recommend The Tax Gator to anyone.</p>
